```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash

You can also create additional superuser accounts if needed:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

```

### 8. Access the Application

- **Main Application**: [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
- **Admin Interface**: [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/)
